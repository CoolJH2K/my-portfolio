# Portfolio Project
## Description
To help me get started for my future careers in web design, my instructer asked me and my classmates to make our own portfolio from scratch. We each had to make sure the website's HTML and CSS were structured properly to make it look visually appealing.
### Why did I make this?
My instructer wanted me to go create my own portfolio so that I would be career-ready by the time the coding bootcamp ended. I also plan on expanding this later on in my career as my experience grows.
### What did I learn?
I learned a about proper HTML structure and CSS!

For HTML, I learned how and when to properly use the *div* and *section* tags so that the page isn't all jumbled up. I've also added some comments to let others know what the HTML tags are for in the event that they decide to check out their browser's Inspect tool.

On the CSS side of things, I learned a lot about how the flexbox properties function and why they're very helpful for web designers. I also learned how to use the percentage symbol to make elements responsive to different device sizes.
